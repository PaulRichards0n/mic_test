Here's the complete code for recording audio using the sounddevice and wave modules in Python. This code will record audio for a specified duration and save it to a WAV file.

This script will record 5 seconds of audio and save it as 'test.wav'. You can change the duration and filename as needed.

To use this code, make sure you have the sounddevice module installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```pip install sounddevice```
